# üçßOUT! (Social App)
### ‚ú® Spend Time Going Out, And Not on Your Screen! ‚ú®
**OUT! lets you find individuals or groups for spontaneous hangouts. Create a hangout room, post it to our feed, and choose who joins your activity or send a joining request to the existing one based on your interest.**

# üß®Market Opportunity
**OUT! is the first mover for a social media app for making friends through casual & spontaneous hangouts.**

THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR for OUT!
- Traditional Social Medias are for your existing connections, not the new ones
- No one will follow you back on social media unless they already know you
- First App that focuses on casual & spontaneous hangout
- We are the first-ever social media app that helps Gen Z hang out with new friends
- Event apps like Meetup and others are for formal and scheduled events, which is not what we are focusing on

# Tech Stack for now
**Frontend**
- React Native (TypeScript)
- Expo
- React Native Reanimated for all the animations
  
**Backend**
- Have not decided, currently using just dummy data


**üìù Noted that**
- This is just a quick demo, not production-grade
- App UI/UX can be a lot more improved
