            <h2>4. Algorithmic Recommendations</h2>
            <p>To enhance your experience, OUT! uses automated algorithms to suggest potential Friends and relevant events on your Home Feed. These recommendations are based on:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>User Activity on the App:</strong> Including your current friend network (e.g., mutual friends increase compatibility likelihood), and your event participation patterns such as the size and category of events you frequently join.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such processing is done in compliance with data minimization and fairness principles in the PDPO.</p>
            <p>These algorithmic processes help us predict user compatibility and personalize event suggestions, making it easier for you to connect with like-minded people and find events that match your interests.</p>
